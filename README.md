## TODO
* Left menu shows list of wishes in a city
* Right side shows all markers (wishes) within that area shown in the map
* Need to connect each wish model with a mark. We need to display wish detail
  on the mark info overlay window. Consider extract a mark model?  How about
  put mark rendering in the wishes collection view render? WishMarkerView. yes!
